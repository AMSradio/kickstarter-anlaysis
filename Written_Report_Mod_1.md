# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We pulled a dataset of information pertaining to Kickstarter campaigns going back to 2009. We analyzed the outcomes of those campaigns.
### Purpose
To provide an analysis of trends for outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns that are categorized as "plays."
## Analysis and Challenges
Challenges included putting the data set into groups based on dollar thresholds and translating EPOC data into real world dates
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
There is a linear trend of success in the April thru July timeframe. August to December reflects a tendency to drastically drop before picking backup again in Spring. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns with goals of 0 to 5000 dollars tend to yeild the best success rate percentage wise. There is also high turnover rate in the 20000 to 24999 range, however, the sample size is substantially smaller than others with the same success ratio. It is encouraging that even though failure to meet goals occurred, there were 0 cancelled campaigns for "plays." Implying that even in failed campaigns, enough traction was generated to at least see the entire campaign through without calling it quits.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
External factors that were not quantifialbe in this dataset are likely impacting launch date analysis. Therefore, a correlation matrix was not provided at this time.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
It is best to strategically roll out the campaign in May and drum up as much support/donations as possible during summer. These times historically have been most favorable to campaigns with the parent category of "Theater." There were cancelled campaigns in the parent category of "Theater" but none of which were attributed to the sub category of "plays."
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
You will want to set your goal to be reasonable. It is recommended that your business plan be evaluated thorughly to ensure that the funding needed is realistic because as the data shows, the more you aspire to go for "the big one" your rate of failure substantially increases beyond 14,000 dollars. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
This dataset is fairly robust and a lot can be looked at from different angles to draw conclusions, correlations, and assess risk. The only things I think that are missing are external factors that influence the timeline of when successful campaigns occur during the year. These external factors would be difficult to quantify regardless, however, that is perhaps one thing to take another look at. Speculation would be the only thing to apply to this criteria at this point. For example, maybe Kickstarter campaigns as a whole are less successful during the Holiday months as people are likely spending their resources elsewhere. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would personally look at the number of backers per successful campaign. Are these successes attributed to multitude of backers and support? Or a handful of angel investors? Things I ask myself. In either case, I would take it a step further and begin to analyze what marketing, social media, and crowd funding activities were applied to get these successful campaigns in front of the right backers (i.e. was the "niche" demographic?). We are able to strategically gauge when and how much to target here, but now what's left is "who" and "how."
