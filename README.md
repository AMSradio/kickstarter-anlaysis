## Successful vs. Failed (statistical analysis)
Successful campaigns tend to be in a range of $3,000 to $3,500
Successful campaigns also tend to have pledges approx. $3,000 to $4,000. The data implies that from a donation or sales strategy standpoint, the focus or push should be in this range
In unsuccessful campaigns, there are wild swings in variation between goals, and the amounts that are pledged. While all pledges would be welcome, strategically and statistically, you would want to focus qualifiable, substantial investments rather than nickel and diming large volumes of potential investors.
## Kickstarter Campaigns in Great Britan (Box and Whisker)

You can see that the average goal is at $4000. This average is pulled up because of a couple ambitious outlier goals set from other campaigns. 
As would be pledges, in particular, one pledge that was 6-7 times the average pledge
Because of this, we see the “true” middle as $2000
We recommend setting your Kickstarter goal at no more than $4000 and no less than $2000, further reinforcing the trends we have seen in the previous datasets for successful
